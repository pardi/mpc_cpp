# mpc_cpp
This is a simple implementation of the MPC algorithm for linear systems in C++.

The class `mpc` allows to define the prediction and control horizon as inputs, and a standalone class for describing the linear system is provided.

# Open problems
The class has some values hardcoded for simplifying the first draft. This disqualifies the cpp for being used in general cases. However, it is in the works the fixing of this issue.
